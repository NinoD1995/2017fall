Web Programming

  Prior to attending SUNY New Paltz, I had pretty much no experience with programming. 
  I’ve used computers since I was about four years old; dial-up was way of the world back then. 
  I had my own AOL account and I just played video games all day. Since beginning college, 
  I’ve taken every computer science class that is required besides Operating Systems and my skill 
  class (which I’m taking now). One of my favorite classes that I’ve taken was Language Processing 
  with Dos Reis. I loved writing compilers and I found them so interesting. It was also pretty amazing 
  when they worked on the first try, which was a rare occurrence. I am familiar with using Java, 
  Assembly Language, C, some Python, and some HTML/CSS. Some programs that I use are Eclipse, 
  Netbeans (for GUIs), and Codeblocks (for C/C++).
  
After completing this class, I hope to be able to build complex and beautiful websites. 
  My dad has been telling me to redo the website for our restaurant so maybe after this class 
  I’d be able to do a complete overhaul and make it look pristine. And hopefully I could build 
  all of the back-end stuff and make it work perfectly. Everything I will learn in this class will be 
  great to put on my resume, also.
